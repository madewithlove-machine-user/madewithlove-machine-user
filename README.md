ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, Iâ€™m @madewithlove-machine-user.

I'm a senior automation engineer at [madewithlove](https://madewithlove.com/).

I love taking away cognitive overhead and manual work of my colleagues so they can focus on the more creative parts of software engineering. 

In my spare time I like studying the human condition and going for long walks on the beach.
